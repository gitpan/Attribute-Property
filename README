NAME
    Attribute::Property - lvalue methods as properties with value
    validation.

SYNOPSIS
  CLASS
        package SomeClass;

        use Attribute::Property;
        use Carp;

        sub new { bless { }, shift }

        sub nondigits : Property { /^\D+\z/ }
        sub digits    : Property { /^\d+\z/ or croak "custom error message" }
        sub anyvalue  : Property;
        sub another   : Property;

  USAGE
        my $object = SomeClass->new;

        $object->nondigits = "abc";
        $object->digits    = "123";
        $object->anyvalue  = "abc123\n";

        $object->anyvalue('archaic style still works');

        # These would croak
        $object->nondigits = "987";
        $object->digits    = "xyz";

DESCRIPTION
    This module introduces the "Property" attribute, which turns your method
    into an object property. The original code block is used only to
    validate new values, the module croaks if it returns false.

    Feel free to croak explicitly if you don't want the default error
    message.

    Undefined subs (subs that have been declared but do not have a code
    block) with the "Property" attribute will be properties without any
    validation.

PREREQUISITES
    Your object must be a blessed hash reference. The property names will be
    used for the hash keys.

COMPATIBILITY
    Old fashioned "$object->property(VALUE)" is still available.

    This module requires a modern Perl, fossils like Perl 5.00x don't
    support our chicanery.

LICENSE
    There is no license. This software was released into the public domain.
